## Consider how we read decimal number system
In order to read binary, it is important to consider how we read docimal which is the number system that we use every day. decimal is base 10 and uses 10 different values, which means that each digit is multipled by 10 to the power of whatever place it is in starting with zero. This may be confusing at first but lets use an example to better explain this concept.
#### Example
* lets use the decimal number 234
    * First digit
        * 4 * (10^0) = `4`
    * Second digit
        * 3 * (10^1) = `30`
    * Third  digit
        * 2 * (10^2) = `200`
    * Finally, we add up the numbers
        * `4 + 30 + 200 = 234`
  
###### This may seem redundant, but it will help when trying to read binary.

## Reading binary
Binary is considered base 2 which means that there are 2 values (0 and 1) and each digit is multiplied by 2 to the power of whatever place the number is. lets use an example
#### Example
* lets use the binary value 1010
    * First digit
        * 0 * (2^0) = `0`
    * Second digit
        * 1 * (2^1) = `2`
    * Third digit
        * 0 * (2^2) = `0`
    * Fourth digit
        * 1 * (2^3) = `8`
    * Finally, we add up the numbers
        * `0 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 10`
